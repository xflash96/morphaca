Our program can run on R217 workstation, we're not sure whether it
can run on other platforms, sorry for inconvenience.

How to test
1. For testing direct morphing, type
	make direct
2. For testing bilinear morphing, type
	make bilinear
3. For testing gaussian morphing(need to wait), type
	make gaussian
4. For testing polymorphing(need to wait), type
	make poly

The results are put in ./test/result
For 2 image morphing, each test will generare a sequence of images.
For polymorphing, it will generate 3 images representing 3 different interpolation methods respectively.
